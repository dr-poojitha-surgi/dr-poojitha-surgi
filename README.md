## Welcome to My GitHubâœ¨

I'm Poojitha Surgi, a passionate learner driven by curiosity and a strong interest in how data, technology, and decision-making come together to solve real-world problems. My background in health informatics and hands-on experience in analytics have shaped the way I think about challenges â€” not just in healthcare, but across industries.

From SQL queries to Python notebooks, from dashboards to machine learning models â€” this is where I explore, learn, and build. Whether itâ€™s healthcare, finance, or anything in between, I love working with data that matters.

Youâ€™ll find a variety of work here, reflecting my passion for data visualization, analytics, health informatics, and machine learning. Iâ€™m constantly exploring new tools, coding techniques, and smarter ways to connect the dots between data and decisions.
